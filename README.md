This applications works with M5Stack M5Dial <https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-dial-esp32-s3-smart-rotary-knob-w-1-28-round-touch-screen> than features
a touch capacitive screen and an encoder.

The device works with any tension from 6 to 36 volts (ideal for a boat) and it may work from a battery opening the way to a truly portable controller.
