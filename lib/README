# Pypilot controller

This is a M5Dial controller for PyPilot.

It makes a TCP connection to the PyPilot at port 23322 and opens a BLE service to configure :
  - Network
  - Password

There are 2 more characteristics 
  - Command : Writable, you may send commands
  - State : Readable, Notify sends state

Will translate commands receive from Command to Pypilot commands and send in state 
pypilot data as :
  - Heading
  - Command
  - Rudder Angle
  - PyPilot Mode
  - Engaged / Not Engaged

  Allowing to write BLE controllers that don't need a TCP connection to PyPilot

## Use and configuration
Service for configuration and use is

  Service f85015df-6af5-4ee3-a8cb-a8f7250d4466

First we must give the controller the ssid and password of the network writing :

  Characteristic bea80929-aa42-4641-a0c2-8f08b70e0aaa ssid
  Characteristic 22643f77-dcfd-4e01-9b9f-bb63692a215f password

  It should lookup for pypilot with mDNS. If changint ip push the crown button when connecting and will clear old host and lookup for a new one.

When connects shows a screen with the 4 modes (Compass, gps, wind, true wind) and a center rudder button. They may be selected just by clicking or selecting with the encoder an clicking the encoder button.

In rudder you manage the rudder by turning the crown to the desired rudder angle. Tap in the center will reset rudder to 0.

In other modes it shows the Heading in the center, an editable desired headingh at top, the mode and two arrous for the tack.

Just change the encoder till top fioeld show desired angle. When you stop the order will be sent to pypilot.

If tapping the mode, it turns red and encoder may be used to change it tapping when the desired mode is hown.

Of course only acceptable modes will be accepted by pypilot depending it's hardware and conections.

Long pressing an arrow turns it red and starts tacking in the direction of the arrow. A tap everywhere cancels the tacking.

A click in the encoder button goes back to the main screen.

## BLE Gateway

The M5Dial also has characteristics 

  Characteristic 02804fff-8c38-485f-964a-474dc4f179b2 Command (writable)
  Characteristic de7f5161-6f48-4c9a-aacc-6079082e6cc7 State (readable, notify)

Usually an application subscribes to State and sends commands to command.

### State

Messages received from State are composed by a first letter (type) and the rest are parameters.

Types of message are

E : Engaged
D : Disengaged
H<degrees> : Heading
R<degrees> : Rudder Angle
C<degrees> : Command
M<int>  : Mode where <int> is:
  0 -> Compass
  1 -> Gps
  2 -> Wind
  3 -> True Wind
  4 -> Manual / Rudder control
T<int> : Tack State where <int> is:
  0 -> none, no tacking
  1 -> begin
  2 -> waiting
  3 -> tacking

U<int> : Tack Direction where <int> is:
  -1 -> Port
  0 -> None
  1 -> Starboard

### Commands

Commands are sent with a string where the first letter is the command and the rest parameters

E -> Engage
D -> Disengage
C<angle> -> Set Command
M<int> -> Set Mode
TP -> Tack port
TS -> Tack Starboard
X -> Cancel Tack
RP -> Rudder to Port (value 1.0)
RS -> Rudder to Starboard (value 1.0)
Z<angle> -> Set rudder angle to angle
